## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A language learner opens the app to practice vocabulary through spaced repetition. They see a summary of new words to learn and reviews due. During study sessions, they view word cards one by one, listen to pronunciations, reveal translations, and mark whether they remembered each word. The system schedules future reviews based on their performance using spaced repetition algorithms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user opens app with pending reviews, **When** they tap "Start Learning", **Then** they see loading screen followed by first word card
2. **Given** user views a word card, **When** they tap the word, **Then** audio pronunciation plays automatically
3. **Given** user completes a study round, **When** session ends, **Then** they see celebration animation and progress summary
4. **Given** user encounters confusing words, **When** system detects similarities, **Then** words appear together in comparison mode for side-by-side practice
5. **Given** user marks word as "Not Remember", **When** 10 minutes pass, **Then** word reappears for review in current or next round

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user has no internet connection but needs audio playback?
- How does system handle interrupted study sessions (app closed mid-session)?
- What occurs when user marks same word incorrectly multiple times in succession?
- How does comparison mode work when one word in group is new and others are familiar?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Study Experience
- **FR-001**: System MUST display word cards individually with word, part of speech, hint, and translation sections
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide audio pronunciation for each word that plays when user taps the word
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to reveal word translations and mark cards as "Remember" or "Not Remember"
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement spaced repetition scheduling based on user performance
- **FR-005**: System MUST group confusing words together in comparison mode when detected

#### Session Management  
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize learning into rounds of configurable size (default 50 events)
- **FR-007**: System MUST show progress indicators displaying current position and total remaining items
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement 10-minute rule: words marked "Not Remember" reappear after 10 minutes
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide session completion celebration and summary statistics
- **FR-010**: System MUST save progress at word level to prevent data loss and enable multi-device usage

#### Deck and Content Management
- **FR-011**: System MUST support multiple decks that can be enabled/disabled for study sessions
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow CSV import with required columns: word, translation and optional columns: part_of_speech, hint
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide pre-built decks for different CEFR levels and themed categories
- **FR-014**: System MUST auto-generate decks based on difficulty, category, or confusing word groups
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain word order from import source (CSV row order, preset deck order)

#### Interface and Interactions
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide mobile-first responsive design with touch gestures and keyboard shortcuts
- **FR-017**: System MUST support swipe gestures: up for "Remember", left for "Not Remember" (mobile only)
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide control panel with back, hint toggle, undo, and settings options
- **FR-019**: System MUST adapt layout for different screen sizes with appropriate card arrangements
- **FR-020**: System MUST disable swipe gestures in comparison mode, using button interactions only

#### Audio System
- **FR-021**: System MUST pre-cache audio for upcoming rounds during loading screens
- **FR-022**: System MUST support both auto-play (configurable) and manual audio playback
- **FR-023**: System MUST highlight first card in comparison groups and play its audio automatically
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide audio generation fallback strategy for reliability

#### Confusing Word Groups
- **FR-025**: System MUST detect potentially confusing words using predefined rules
- **FR-026**: System MUST allow users to create and edit custom confusing word groups
- **FR-027**: System MUST display entire confusing word groups together as single events in study flow
- **FR-028**: System MUST prioritize less familiar groups when word belongs to multiple groups
- **FR-029**: System MUST provide dedicated comparison mode deck for practicing all confusing groups

#### Progress and Analytics
- **FR-030**: System MUST track learning statistics including daily streaks, success rates, and card statuses  
- **FR-031**: System MUST provide per-deck progress and performance metrics
- **FR-032**: System MUST maintain word-level performance history for scheduling decisions
- **FR-033**: System MUST classify cards as Easy/Medium/Hard based on recent review performance

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-002**: System MUST work offline for previously cached content and sync when connection restored
- **NFR-003**: System MUST support responsive breakpoints: <768px, 768px-1024px, 1024px-1440px, >1440px
- **NFR-004**: System MUST maintain minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility
- **NFR-005**: System MUST handle concurrent usage across multiple devices without data conflicts

### Key Entities *(data involved)*
- **Word Card**: Individual vocabulary item with word text, translation, part of speech, hint, learning metrics
- **Deck**: Collection of word cards with metadata like source, category, CEFR level, enable status
- **Learning Session**: Time-bounded study period with rounds, progress tracking, and completion status  
- **User Progress**: Per-word learning statistics, review history, scheduling data, performance metrics
- **Confusing Word Group**: Collection of similar words for comparison practice with user/system definitions
- **Audio Cache**: Pronunciation files with pre-loading strategy and fallback generation options
